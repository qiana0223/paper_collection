It provides the basis for the realization of a variety of practical blockchain applications and plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem. While it also holds a large number of digital assets, the frequent occurrence of smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge economic losses and destroyed the blockchain-based credit system. Currently, the security and reliability of smart contracts have become a new focus of research, and there are a number of smart contract vulnerability detection methods, such as traditional detection tools based on static or dynamic analysis. However, most of them often rely on expert rules, and therefore have poor scalability and high false negative and false positive rates. Recent deep learning methods alleviate this issue, but without considering the semantic information and context of source code. To this end, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism (HAM) model to detect security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We extract code fragments from the source code, which focus on key points of vulnerability. We conduct extensive experiments on two public smart contract datasets (a total of 24,957 contracts). Empirical results show remarkable accuracy improvement over the state-of-the art methods on five kinds of vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy could achieve 93.36%, 80.85%, 82.56%, 85.62%, and 82.19% for reentrancy, arithmetic vulnerability, unchecked return value, timestamp dependency, and tx.origin, respectively.},</br>DOI = {10.3390/app13020770}</br>}</br></br></br></details>|<details><summary>abstract</summary>&nbsp;</details> |

Given the recent growth of Ethereum, the cryptocurrency community and researchers are interested in understanding the Ethereum transactions behavior. In this work, we investigate a key aspect of Ethereum: the prediction of a transaction confirmation or failure based on its features. This is a challenging issue due to the small, but still relevant, fraction of failures in millions of recorded transactions and the complexity of the distributed mechanism to execute transactions in Ethereum. To conduct this investigation, we train machine learning models for this prediction, taking into consideration carefully balanced sets of confirmed and failed transactions. The results show high-performance models for classification of transactions with the best values of F1-score and area under the ROC curve approximately equal to 0.67 and 0.87, respectively. Also, we identified the gas used as the most relevant feature for the prediction.</details> |

The novelty of our framework is that it relies only on transaction metadata and balance data from the blockchain system; our approach requires no domain knowledge, code instrumentation, or special execution environment. Dynamit extracts features from transaction data and uses a machine learning model to classify transactions as benign or harmful. Therefore, not only can we find the contracts that are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, but we also get an execution trace that reproduces the attack. Using a random forest classifier, our model achieved more than 90 percent accuracy on 105 transactions, showing the potential of our technique.</details> |

However, the scalability of symbolic execution is often limited by path explosion, i.e., the number of symbolic states representing the paths under exploration quickly explodes as execution goes on. Therefore, the effectiveness of symbolic execution engines hinges on the ability to select and explore the right symbolic states.In this work, we propose a novel learning-based strategy, called Learch, able to effectively select promising states for symbolic execution to tackle the path explosion problem. Learch directly estimates the contribution of each state towards the goal of maximizing coverage within a time budget, as opposed to relying on manually crafted heuristics based on simple statistics as a crude proxy for the objective. Moreover, Learch leverages existing heuristics in training data generation and feature extraction, and can thus benefit from any new expert-designed heuristics. We instantiated Learch in KLEE, a widely adopted symbolic execution engine. We evaluated Learch on a diverse set of programs, showing that Learch is practically effective: it covers more code and detects more security violations than existing manual heuristics, as well as combinations of those heuristics. We also show that using tests generated by Learch as initial fuzzing seeds enables the popular fuzzer AFL to find more paths and security violations.</details> |

Because smart contracts are stateful programs whose states are altered by transactions, diagnosing and understanding nontrivial vulnerabilities requires generating sequences of transactions that demonstrate the flaws. However, finding such vulnerable transaction sequences is challenging as the number of possible combinations of transactions is intractably large. As a result, most existing tools for smart contract analysis use abstractions and merely point out the locations of vulnerabilities, which in turn imposes a steep burden on users of understanding the bugs, or have limited power in generating transaction sequences. In this paper, we aim to overcome this challenge by combining symbolic execution with a language model for vulnerable transaction sequences, so that symbolic execution effectively prioritizes program paths that are likely to reveal vulnerabilities. Experimental results with real-world smart contracts show that SmarTest significantly outperforms existing tools by finding more vulnerable transaction sequences including critical zero-day vulnerabilities.</details> |

Meanwhile, various vulnerabilities in smart contracts have been exploited by attackers to steal cryptocurrencies worth millions of dollars. The automatic detection of smart contract vulnerabilities therefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem particularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to detect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be ignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this study, to overcome such challenges, we propose the VSCL framework to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically, first, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of smart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in public. Next, the collected vectors are fed into our novel metric learning-based deep neural network(DNN) to get the detection result. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a large-scale benchmark, and the quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</details> |

However, data island and computing resources limitations in the centralized AI architectures have increased their technical barriers, and thus distributed AI collaboration in data, models and resources has attracted intensive research interests. Since the existing trust-based collaboration models are no longer applicable for the large-scale distributed collaboration among trustless machines in open and dynamic environments, this paper proposes a novel decentralized AI collaboration framework, i.e., Learning Markets (LM), in which blockchain provides a trustless environment for collaboration and transaction, while smart contracts serve as software-defined agents to encapsulate and process scalable collaboration relationships and market mechanisms. LM can not only help those participants without mutual trust realize collaborative mining with dynamic and quantitative rewards, but also build an AI market with natural auditability and traceability for trading trusted and verified models. We implement and comprehensively analyze LM based on the Ethereum and IPFS platform, and the results prove that it has advantages in collaboration fairness, transparency, security, decentralization and universality. Based on our collaboration framework, distributed AI contributors are expected to cooperate and complete those learning tasks that cannot be done previously due to lack of complete data, sufficient computing resources and state-of-the-art models.</details> |

To accurately detect these bugs, the developer must use several state-of-the-art bug detection tools and investigate the potential bugs they report. In this study, we first show that one tool is not enough to detect all the bugs as our Static Analysis for Solidity tool (SA-Solidity) and the known SmartCheck and Securify tools identify different bugs in SmartEmbed's experimental set of smart contracts. Then, we develop Machine Learning-based Bug Predictor for Solidity (MLBP-Solidity) which predicts files that would be reported by all the previous bug detection tools. MLBP-Solidity eases the burden on the developer by allowing him/her to focus on a subset of files that are most probably buggy. Our experimental results show that MLBP-Solidity achieves 91-99% accuracy, depending on the type of predicted bug.</details> |

Fuzzing is fast and scalable, but can be ineffective when it fails to randomly select the right inputs. Symbolic execution is thorough but slow and often does not scale to deep program paths with complex path conditions. In this work, we propose to learn an effective and fast fuzzer from symbolic execution, by phrasing the learning task in the framework of imitation learning. During learning, a symbolic execution expert generates a large number of quality inputs improving coverage on thousands of programs. Then, a fuzzing policy, represented with a suitable architecture of neural networks, is trained on the generated dataset. The learned policy can then be used to fuzz new programs. We instantiate our approach to the problem of fuzzing smart contracts, a domain where contracts often implement similar functionality (facilitating learning) and security is of utmost importance. We present an end-to-end system, ILF (for Imitation Learning based Fuzzer), and an extensive evaluation over &gt;18K contracts. Our results show that ILF is effective: (i) it is fast, generating 148 transactions per second, (ii) it outperforms existing fuzzers (e.g., achieving 33% more coverage), and (iii) it detects more vulnerabilities than existing fuzzing and symbolic execution tools for Ethereum.</details> |
